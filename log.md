| 76 | Thu&nbsp;September&nbsp;7 | <h4>Day 76 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[Javascript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Watched exercise \#21 - Geolocation. <li> *Show Time* (Ember): <br>Finished the Show edit/create modal dialog with associated template updates. Like the way it works much better now. Ran into a bug and had to work around it by renaming show.length attribute to show.showLength. Work merged to master branch and new demo deployed.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Making the show edit/create modal dialog a component really cleaned up the template and controller code. Totally worth it. Went smoother than I thought, looks like I have a better understanding of component context, now. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 76 Work: [100doc-d76 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d76) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 77 | Fri September 8 | <h4>Day 77 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <br>Added the start time for each show element to the show page. A bit of a challenge since the element start time depends on the length of all the previous elements. Wasn't sure how to do it in Ember. After a false start it all came together. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Today I both loved and hated Ember. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 77 Work: [100doc-d77 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d77) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
