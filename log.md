| 51 | Sun&nbsp;August&nbsp;13 | <h4>Day 51 Progress:</h4>  <ul><li>*[Javascript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*:<br> Did Day 3 - Update CSS Variables with JS <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> Dug into configuring responsive images with the *Responsive Image* module. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>First look at CSS variables. Syntax is weird, but functionality is great. Wonderful there's clean JS methods for updating the variables. <li>Oh vey, so much planning required for implementing responsive images using the modules. Not something I'd want to do by the seat of my pants.</ul> |
| 52 | Mon August 14 | <h4>Day 52 Progress</h4> <ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "Day 4: Array Cardio Day 1" exercise. <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Have gotten bogged down in the theming, which isn't my strength. Took a step back and mapped out how to move forward.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>The JavaScript 30 exercise on arrays was excellent. I had noodled around with filter, map, and reduce in the past, but hadn't really dug into them. <li>I miss Emily, the designer/themer I used to work with! She made theming look so easy. Hoping the planning I did today helps move me forward a bit faster than the current pace.</ul> |
| 53 | Tue August 15 | <h4>Day 53 Progress:</h4><ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "Day 5: Flex Panel Gallery" exercise. <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Began building out the site section pages using Panels. Some big differences from Drupal 7.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4><ul><li>*Javascript 30*: Another fun exercise. The info on Flex box arguably weak, but strength of exercise was showing how to use for UX. <li>Not sure Panels is the best choice for implementing sections. The implementation is still anemic. Going to try. Panels still seems more elegant than page visibility rules. <li>Moving the taxonomy listing from system generated to View generated in D8 has an annoying side-effect. In D7 the term display could be selectively overriden. Now the View has to disabled, mean you have to replace the default.</ul> |
