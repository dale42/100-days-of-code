| Day | Date | Progress &amp; Thoughts |
|:--:|:--:|---|
| 1 | Thu&nbsp;June&nbsp;22 | **Today's Progress:**<br>Applied Drupal configuration management setting to site rebuild script and refactored script to use variables instead of hardcoded values<br><br>**Thoughts:**<br>- Feels like a weak start, but it is what it is<br>- Always takes longer to test than I expect<br>- Would be nice to work this into a template<br>- BASH is archane <br><br>**Link to work:** [site-rebuild.sh](https://gist.github.com/dale42/be415d17404151d49baacb20a1400317) |
| 2 | Fri&nbsp;June&nbsp;23 | **Today's Progress:**<br>Started on radio programming timing app named *ShowTime*. Will be a simple, one-page Ember app. Thumbnailed design, created GitHub repo, and created initial app.<br><br>**Thoughts:** Feels good to be coding.<br><br>**Link to work:** [ShowTime on Github](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) |
| 3 | Sat&nbsp;June&nbsp;24 | **Today's Progress:**<br>Worked on *ShowTime* app. Wrote my first Ember unit test. Updated models.<br>2hr 39m<br><br>**Thoughts:**<br>I hate this part of the learning curve where a simple thing can take hours to figure out. Realized after I coded it that displayLength doesn't belong on module. Need to refactor into something that gives raw minutes and seconds. Did lots of research that didn't count towards the coding.<br><br>**Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day3-work |
| 4 | Sun&nbsp;June&nbsp;25 | **Today's Progress:**<br>*ShowTime* app: Added local storage, show item display, and the ability to create and delete show items. Discovered that unit tests wouldn't run when the serializer and adapter tests were present.<br><br>**Thoughts:**<br>Bootstrap is a mixed blessing. Stoked at figuring out how to sum the times from the times from individual items and display as a total.<br><br>**Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day4-work |
| 5 | Mon&nbsp;June&nbsp;26 | **Today's Progress:**<br>*ShowTime* app: Initially thought it would be a one-page style calculator, but since local storage was so easy decided to expand and allow multiple shows. Did not merge *100doc-day05-work* branch into *master*, app is in an inbetween state.<br>- Cleaned up show item table<br>- Added /show page to list shows<br>- Added show add/delete functions<br>- Added /show/:showId route<br>- Researched drag and drop sorting of items in radio show. <br><br>**Thoughts:**<br>Damn you Jim Butcher and you're books that make me stay up late reading so I'm tired the next day<br><br> **Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day05-work |
| 6 | Tue June 27 | **Today's Progress:**<br>*ShowTime* (Ember) app:<br>- Handles multiple shows<br>- Cleaned up "the look"<br>- Researching date-time libraries.<br><br>**Thoughts:**<br>The Ember Data hasMany/belongsTo relationship is really finicky.<br><br>**Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day06-work |
| 7 | Wed June 28 | **Today's Progress:**<br>*ShowTime* (Ember) app: Only a small code update, creating a show takes you the newly created show page. Discovered that doing input validation is a rabbit hole and spent the rest of my available time researching.<br><br>**Thoughts:**<br>Would have never guessed at the lack of support input validation has in core Ember.<br><br>**Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day07-work |
| 8 | Thu June 29 | <h4>Day 8 Progress:</h4>*ShowTime* (Ember) app:<ul><li>Refactored some display elements into components ( dale42/showtime#15, dale42/showtime#16) <li>Updated show delete to remove child show-items (dale42/showtime#12). This doesn't seem to be an ember-data feature. <li>Created a GitHub Pages site for project (dale42/showtime#3): https://dale42.github.io/showtime <li>Updated project README.md </ul>   <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>Components are brutally simple, at least to start. Wish I'd checked them out sooner. <li>Adding the ability to deploy to GitHub pages went more smoothly than I expected. <li>Committing the deployment into the repo makes this less a project for others to clone than a standalone app, but I'm OK with that, for now.</ul> **Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day08-work |
