| 3 | Sat&nbsp;June&nbsp;24 | **Today's Projess:**<br>Worked on *ShowTime* app. Wrote my first Ember unit test. Updated models.<br>2hr 39m<br><br>**Thoughts:**<br>I hate this part of the learning curve where a simple thing can take hours to figure out. Realized after I coded it that displayLength doesn't belong on module. Need to refactor into something that gives raw minutes and seconds. Did lots of research that didn't count towards the coding.<br><br>**Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day3-work |
