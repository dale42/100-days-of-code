| Day | Date | Progress &amp; Thoughts |
|:--:|:--:|---|
| 51 | Sun&nbsp;August&nbsp;13 | <h4>Day 51 Progress:</h4>  <ul><li>*[Javascript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*:<br> Did Day 3 - Update CSS Variables with JS <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> Dug into configuring responsive images with the *Responsive Image* module. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>First look at CSS variables. Syntax is weird, but functionality is great. Wonderful there's clean JS methods for updating the variables. <li>Oh vey, so much planning required for implementing responsive images using the modules. Not something I'd want to do by the seat of my pants.</ul> |
| 52 | Mon&nbsp;August&nbsp;14 | <h4>Day 52 Progress</h4> <ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "Day 4: Array Cardio Day 1" exercise. <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Have gotten bogged down in the theming, which isn't my strength. Took a step back and mapped out how to move forward.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>The JavaScript 30 exercise on arrays was excellent. I had noodled around with filter, map, and reduce in the past, but hadn't really dug into them. <li>I miss Emily, the designer/themer I used to work with! She made theming look so easy. Hoping the planning I did today helps move me forward a bit faster than the current pace.</ul> |
| 53 | Tue August 15 | <h4>Day 53 Progress:</h4><ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "Day 5: Flex Panel Gallery" exercise. <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Began building out the site section pages using Panels. Some big differences from Drupal 7.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4><ul><li>*Javascript 30*: Another fun exercise. The info on Flex box arguably weak, but strength of exercise was showing how to use for UX. <li>Not sure Panels is the best choice for implementing sections. The implementation is still anemic. Going to try. Panels still seems more elegant than page visibility rules. <li>Moving the taxonomy listing from system generated to View generated in D8 has an annoying side-effect. In D7 the term display could be selectively overriden. Now the View has to disabled, mean you have to replace the default.</ul> |
| 54 | Wed&nbsp;August&nbsp;16 | <h4>Day 54 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "#6: Ajax Type Ahead" exercise. <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Continued on building out the site. I have a minimum viable release, now. Need to go back to theming.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>Today's *JavaScript 30* exercise really helped me wrap my head around the power of map and filter. Also liking the improvements in ES6. Native JavaScript is much nicer to work in. <li>Back to the theming on *Group 42*. Needing to deep-dive into the design.</ul> |
| 55 | Thu August 17 | <h4>Day 55 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "#7: Array Cardio 2" exercise. <li>*Show Time* (Ember): <br>Time to give this some love. Reviewed my work to date against what I know and planned how to move forward.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>*Javascript 30*: Another cool exercise <li>*Show Time*: Was very nice to realize in my planning that I now have an interalized conceptual knowledge of Ember. Very basic, but there. Will see how accurate it is when I implement my new architecture. </ul> |
| 56 | Fri August 18 | <h4>Day 56 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "#8: HTML 5 Canvas" exercise. <li>*Show Time* (Ember): <br>Started working on the refactoring. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>*Javascript 30*: I played around with HTML 5 Canvas once before, but just for creating an image from program results. It was nice encorporating user interaction (mouse events) into the canvas manipulation. <li>*Show Time*: After a little of bit refactoring I decided it's probably easy to start from scratch. Things started getting messy and confusing pretty quickly. I'm not so far along that I think it would take any longer. I really want to be a large workblock of into this. Can only currently only do short workblocks and it's frustrating.</ul> |
| 57 | Sat August 19 | <h4>Day 57 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "#9: 14 Must Know Dev Tools Tricks" exercise. <li>*Show Time* (Ember): <br>Blew away the old repository and started fresh. Implemented the Add/Delete/List functionality and set up GitHub pages demo app.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> *Show Time* <ul><li>Starting from scratch was definitely the right thing to do. I regret loosing the Issues and some of the comments. <li>Things go so much quicker when you've already written the code somewhere else :) </ul> <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 57 Work: [100doc-57 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d57) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime) </ul> |
| 58 | Sun August 20 | <h4>Day 58 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <br>Added a shows/show page and the ability the add and delete show elements from a show. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Definitely have a better understanding of what's happening this time around. Happy how quickly I'm getting this version to the same place as the scrapped version. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 58 Work: [100doc-d58 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d58) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime) </ul> |
| 59 | Mon August 21 | <h4>Day 59 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <br>Added draggable sort to the Show page using the *ember-sortable* addon. Show elements can now be sorted by dragging. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Love it when there's a addon that does the heavy-lifting! Once again encountered the bug that doesn't map asset URLs correctly if the root URL isn't '/'. The drag grip doesn't show up on the GitHub demo. Looking a work arounds. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 59 Work: [100doc-d59 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d59) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime) </ul> |
| 60 | Tue August 22 | <h4>Day 60 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <br>Replaced the drag handle with purely CSS image to avoid the image deployment problem. Also wrote a display formatter for element length. Began work on an input parser for the time. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Wish I had more time to work on this, today. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 60 Work: [100doc-d60 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d60) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime) </ul> |
| 61 | Wed August 23 | <h4>Day 61 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <br>Finished the time entry parser function that converts a number of different time notations to seconds. Did a quick implementation on the element entry form. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> This was the first serious bit of JavaScript programming I've had to do in a while. It was very satisfying how everything came together (Though I still want to do a bit of refactoring). The app is a bit more robust now that time doesn't have to be entered in seconds :) <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 61 Work: [100doc-d61 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d61) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime) </ul> |
| 62 | Thu August 24 | <h4>Day 62 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <ul><li>Worked around a nasty bug where the show elements hasMany relationship was not updated when the last element was removed. Left reference to non-existent record and application died. <li>Refactored the time input parsing function and found/fixed a bug before it became a problem. <li>Added "Total Length" to the show field. It's the total of all the element lengths. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>Have used two different local storage addons and all of the data issues I've had have been around the hasMany/belongsTo relationships. <li>Ember.computed is so powerful. <li>Very, very happy the app is basically usuable! </ul> <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 62 Work: [100doc-d62 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d62) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime) </ul> |
| 63 | Fri August 25 | <h4>Day 63 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <br> Added modal deletion confirmation for shows and show elements.  <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 63 Work: [100doc-d63 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d63) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime) </ul> |
| 64 | Sat August 26 | <h4>Day 64 Progress</h4> *JavaScript 30*:<br> Did exercise \#10: Hold Shift to Check Multiple Checkboxes <h4>Thoughts:</h4> This was a cool little exercise. Made me think and I learned a handy bit of logic. There's a bug in the given solution. |
| 65 | Sun August 27 | <h4>Day 65 Progress:</h4>  *JavaScript 30*:<br> Did exercise \#11: Custom HTML5 Video Player <h4>Thoughts:</h4> I think the trick to working with video is finding a good reference for all the event names and methods! Fun working with video. |
| 66 | Mon August 28 | <h4>Day 66 Progess:</h4> <ul><li>*JavaScript 30*:<br> Did exercise \#12 - Key Sequence Detection. It was short video so I did some additional playing around. <li>*Show Time* (Ember)<br>Did some thinking/planning/research for a *Show Time* file download feature.<li>*My Notes:* <br>Planning for personal project I've been noodling around with for a while. A way of capturing and publishing my notes. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> There are so many things I want to work on it's hard to focus. Capturing thoughts into notes is a way of getting the other projects out of my system a little bit. 
| 67 | Tue August 29 | <h4>Day 67 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*JavaScript 30*:<br> Did exercise \#13 - Slide in on Scroll <li>*Show Time* (Ember): <br>Added button to download a show as a text file. Uses the FileSaver.js npm library.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>Today's *JavaScript 30* exercise did most of the heavy lifting. Was still useful for learning the bits that were presented. <li>Hope I'm not jinxing anything, but today's work on *Show Time* went relatively smoothly. </ul> <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 67 Work: [100doc-d67 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d67) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime) </ul> |
