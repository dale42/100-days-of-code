| Day | Date | Progress &amp; Thoughts |
|:--:|:--:|---|
| 26 | Wed&nbsp;July&nbsp;19 | <h4>Day 26 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> Finished migration plugin, setup_inline_images, that converts the image tags in the node body to use the migrated inline image file, if one was created. It also applies the appropriate data attributes so the CKEditor inline image plugin works. <h4>Thoughts:</h4>Thought I would have problems with the regex, but that went quickly. Figured out looking up Drupal entities by attribute went about how I expected. Didn't think the longest bit would be finding the Drupal function to create a relative URL from a file URI! |
| 27 | Thu July 20 | <h4>Day 27 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> <ul><li>Added logging messages for skipped records instead of silently skipping. Surfaced some data that needs cleaning up. Tried to identify a way of logging the content ID (node ID) with the message, but this isn't available at the migration plugin level. Couldn't find a way around it. <li>Figured out why my workflow was broken. It was a brainfart of my part not entering a full path.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Trying to figure out how to get the node id lead me on a merry chase through a lot of code. Though I failed at getting the node id I learned a lot about migrate. |
| 28 | Fri July 21 | <h4>Day 28 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> <ul><li>Asked about getting node id for the migrate messages on a help channel. No one answered :( <li>Did a quick analysis of the ways I was floating images on the current site. Updated the migrate inline-image plugin to evaluate the style and class attributes and assign the proper image class. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Feeling very good about the inline image plugin. It takes a hodge-podge moves it nicely into the standard Drupal 8 way of doing things. |
| 29 | Sat July 22 | <h4>Day 29 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> Wrote a new Migrate plugin to convert code examples in body text to use the HTML tags required for the *CodeSnippets* module. Relies heavily on regular expressions. Coding the regex went much better than I had hoped. There was only one expression that took some experimenting. Very happy with how good the code examples look. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Working with white space characters is a real pain. Didn't make progress until I used str_replace and converted spaces to periods and newlines to pipes ("\|") so I could actually see what the characters were. Also, search "regex memes" in Google Images if you want a laugh. |
| 30 | Sun July 23 | <h4>Day 30 Progress:</h4> *Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> Almost forgot to migrate comments! Added comment migration. Ran into a problem because I'm not migrating all the nodes, comments without a parent node break things like the comment admin page. Had to figure out how to exclude comments for nodes that weren't migrated. Figured out an easy way with migration_lookup and skip_on_empty plugins. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Feeling very confident with Migrate. Still lots I don't know, but I have a solid understanding of the basics and a strategy for troubleshooting issues. |
| 31 | Mon&nbsp;July&nbsp;24 | <h4>Day 31 Progress:</h4>  *Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> One of the learning outcomes for this work is a document I can use as a starting point for other site migrations. I updated my *Migration Specification* document with the work to date. It's not complete, but in the spirit of showing work-in-progress I've uploaded it to the repo. While I was updating the doc I realized I missed a file migration detail, I need to handle txt files as well as images. One more day of migration work, it seems! <h4>Thoughts:</h4> There's nothing like documentation and specifications to make me realize how loosely I use some terms or how involved even a simple project can be. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>[Website Migration Specifications (July 24, 2017/WIP)](https://github.com/dale42/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Work-In-Progress/G42-2017-PD-Migration.pdf)</ul> |
| 32 | Tue July 25 | <h4>Day 32 Progress:</h4> *Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> <ul><li>Updated the destination site with new field configuration (added Files field) to match new understanding. <li>Updated file migration to selectively place files in the correct directory based on file extension. Managed to add this logic without creating a custom plugin. <li>Updated Story to Article migration to add text files to new Files field. This required a custom plugin to select only text files <li>Updated migration spec. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Think I'm finally done with the migration. It feels good to finally understand it. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>[Website Migration Specifications (July 25, 2017/WIP)](https://github.com/dale42/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Work-In-Progress/G42-2017-PD-Migration.pdf)</ul> |
| 33 | Wed July 26 | <h4>Day 33 Progress:</h4> *Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> <ul><li>Began working on wireframes. Have hand-drawn wireframes, want to work them into something I can implement a theme, from. Watched sections 1 to 3 of Lynda.com video: *Sketch for UX Design*. <li>Wanted to confirm some aspects of image handling before I got to deep in design. Checked out *Image Widget Crop* module. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> I am simultaneiously looking forward to and dreading this part of the project. This is taking me outside of my core compentancies. |
| 34 | Thu July 27 | <h4>Day 34 Progress:</h4> *Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> <ul><li>Investigated [Basic](https://drupal.org/project/basic) theme as starting point for site theme. <li>Started working on wireframes/comps in Sketch App</ul> <h4>Thoughts</h4> As much as wireframes are needed for the project they really aren't coding. Don't think I continue to consider them as such. |
| 35 | Fri July 28 | <h4>Day 35 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Continued work on wireframes/comps. <li>*Song Library* (Ember): <br>Started working from the book, [Rock and Roll with Ember.js](https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs). Finished the first 3 chapters: Introduction, Ember CLI, and Templates and databindings. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Definitely happier mixing actual code work with wireframing. <h4>Links to Work</h4> <ul><li>[Song Library project from Rock and Roll with Ember](https://github.com/dale42/rarwe-songlib) |
| 36 | Sat July 29 | <h4>Day 36 Progress:</h4> *Song Library* (Ember): <br>Finished the next 2 chapters from [Rock and Roll with Ember.js](https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs): *Routing*, *Nested routes*. <h4>Thoughts:</h4>A lot of review but useful for reinforcing and solidifying current knowledge. <h4>Links to Work</h4> <ul><li>[Song Library project GitHub repo from Rock and Roll with Ember](https://github.com/dale42/rarwe-songlib) <li>[Song Library App on GitHub Pages](https://dale42.github.io/rarwe-songlib/#/bands/) </ul> |
| 37 | Sun July 30 | <h4>Day 37 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*Song Library* (Ember): <br>Finished the next 2 chapters from [Rock and Roll with Ember.js](https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs): *Actions*, *Components*. <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Learning Sketch App while working on wireframes and comps. Rewatched selected exercises from [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/) course, *Sketch for UX Design*. Researching typography and starting on style guide.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>Picking up many useful Ember tidbits. Some are quite subtle. <li>Having a *lot* of fun learning Sketch. This is an area I've felt weak in. Starting to feel like I have the tools and knowledge to do this. At the very least, feeling more comforable.</ul> <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>[Song Library project GitHub repo from Rock and Roll with Ember](https://github.com/dale42/rarwe-songlib) <li>[Song Library App on GitHub Pages](https://dale42.github.io/rarwe-songlib/#/bands/)</ul> |
| 38 | Mon July 31 | <h4>Day 38 Progress:</h4> *Song Library* (Ember):<br> Finished the next 2 chapters from [Rock and Roll with Ember.js](https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs): *Controllers*, *Advanced routing* <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Typing in new code instead of copy/paste is much better for reinforcement (d'ur). Getting into stuff I haven't encountered before so learned some new things. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>[Song Library project GitHub repo from Rock and Roll with Ember](https://github.com/dale42/rarwe-songlib) <li>[Song Library App on GitHub Pages](https://dale42.github.io/rarwe-songlib)</ul> |
| 39 | Tue Aug 1 | <h4>Day 39 Progress</h4> *Song Library* (Ember):<br> Finished the *Talking to the backend with Ember Data* chapter from [Rock and Roll with Ember.js](https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs) <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Picking up many nuances that are not obvious from the code. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>[Song Library project GitHub repo from Rock and Roll with Ember](https://github.com/dale42/rarwe-songlib) </ul>|
| 40 | Wed Aug 2 | <h4>Day 40 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*Song Library* (Ember):<br> Working through *Testing* chapter from [Rock and Roll with Ember.js](https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs) <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Merged Migrate work into the master branch. Configured the build scripts to do all of the migration work and then remove all trace of migrate components. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Happy that I'm learning more about Ember testing. This is a weak spot for me. It's slow going because of requirement to create mock data. |
| 41 | Thu Aug 3 | <h4>Day 41 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*Song Library* (Ember):<br> Finished *Testing* chapter and started on *Sorting and Searching with Query Parameters* chapter from [Rock and Roll with Ember.js](https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs) <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Working on front page design </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Learning a lot of new Ember things. Design is very satisfying, even though I'm not good at it, and very slow. |
| 42 | Fri Aug 4 | <h4>Day 42 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*Song Library* (Ember):<br> Finished *Sorting and Searching with Query Parameters* and *Loading and error routes* chapter from [Rock and Roll with Ember.js](https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs) <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Started theming!</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>Learned some really useful things in Ember I never knew about. Very happy. <li>It feels good to actually start theming Group 42. Using a theme that only provides the most basic skeleton and uses SASS. There is a lot of new stuff to absorb, so very slow going. <li>I seem to understand more CSS than I thought I did. <li>42! If only this day answered the question of Life, the Universe, and everything. <li>Partially themed pages look so sad </ul> <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>[Song Library project GitHub repo from Rock and Roll with Ember](https://github.com/dale42/rarwe-songlib) </ul> |
| 43 | Sat Aug 5 | <h4>Day 43 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*Song Library* (Ember):<br> Finished *Helpers* and *Animations* chapters from [Rock and Roll with Ember.js](https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs) <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>A little bit of theming. Experimented with *JSON content* module for fixed content creation. Mostly got lost chasing a *Pathauto* bug. [URL Alias not saving in some cases](https://www.drupal.org/node/2756703) </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>I really wish I'd worked to the end of *Rock and Roll with Ember.js* the first time I used it. The last half of the book is where the real refinement happens. <li>Starting to get the hang of theming in Drupal 8. Or feeling less useless :) <li>This *Pathauto* bug is really frustrating. Torn about doing a deep dive, which would help me learn the code, or moving on and not getting hung up. The advantage of the scripting is I can tweak the content creation later. <li>G'ah, bugs can be such a distraction </ul> <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>[Song Library project GitHub repo from Rock and Roll with Ember](https://github.com/dale42/rarwe-songlib) </ul> |
| 44 | Sun Aug 6 | <h4>Day 44 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*Song Library* (Ember):<br> Finished *Add-ons* and *Writing Modern JavaScript* chapters from [Rock and Roll with Ember.js](https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs) <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <ul><li>Updated my content creation script, moved from *Default content* to *YAML content* module. It's better suited for my use case. <li>Started implementing some of the front page components. The comps aren't finished, but bouncing around is easier because I'm still learning on all fronts. Work in one area informs work in another.</ul></ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Almost finished *Rock and Roll with Ember.js*! The last third of the book really brings the project home. Looking forward to applying knowledge to a project of my own. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>[Song Library project GitHub repo from Rock and Roll with Ember](https://github.com/dale42/rarwe-songlib) </ul> |
