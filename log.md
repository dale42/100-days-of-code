| 76 | Thu&nbsp;September&nbsp;7 | <h4>Day 76 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[Javascript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Watched exercise \#21 - Geolocation. <li> *Show Time* (Ember): <br>Finished the Show edit/create modal dialog with associated template updates. Like the way it works much better now. Ran into a bug and had to work around it by renaming show.length attribute to show.showLength. Work merged to master branch and new demo deployed.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Making the show edit/create modal dialog a component really cleaned up the template and controller code. Totally worth it. Went smoother than I thought, looks like I have a better understanding of component context, now. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 76 Work: [100doc-d76 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d76) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 77 | Fri September 8 | <h4>Day 77 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <br>Added the start time for each show element to the show page. A bit of a challenge since the element start time depends on the length of all the previous elements. Wasn't sure how to do it in Ember. After a false start it all came together. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Today I both loved and hated Ember. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 77 Work: [100doc-d77 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d77) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 78 | Sat September 9 | <h4>Day 78 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember):<br> A few little things: <ul><li>Tweak to "colon" format option (00:00:00) on format-length helper <li>Added help text to Create Show modal inputs <li>Started on a show length over/under display <li>Renamed show.showLength to show.slotLength </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4>Have all the basic functionality. Removing the rough edges and improving the UI/UX. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 78 Work: [100doc-d78 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d78) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 79 | Sun&nbsp;September&nbsp;10 | <h4>Day 79 Progress</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <ul><li>Installed ember-moment (moment.js). Going to replace display functions with it. <li>Fixed secondsToDisplayLength unit test <li>Added an improved string-to-time input parser: parseStringToSeconds, and added unit tests for it. This provides error messaging for bad input and will replace stringToSeconds. <li>Implemented parseStringToSeconds on shows/show add element input and added error messages </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> I really like the improved UX with the error messages but it's a lot more work to implement than I expected. It makes the form handling more complicated. A bit frustrating how I keep finding edge cases to deal with. Unit testing for parseStringToSeconds was incredibly helpful. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 79 Work: [100doc-d79 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d79) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 80 | Mon&nbsp;September&nbsp;11 | <h4>Day 80 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <ul><li>Switched Show create/edit modal to new time parser and added validation to slot length field <li>Completed refactoring of showLength to slotLenght <li>Fixed an edge case issue parsing "ns n" <li>Updated time parser so space between value and unit is ok (e.g.: 1 m) </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Close to the point of being done with this. Thinking about my burn down list. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 80 Work: [100doc-d80 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d80) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 81 | Tue September 12 | <h4>Day 81 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <ul><li>Updated element create/edit to use the new time parser <li>Added validation for show start time <li>Start time now stored in a normalized way </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Continue to be impressed by the power of Ember computed properties. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 81 Work: [100doc-d81 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d81) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 82 | Wed September 13 | <h4>Day 82 Progress:</h4>  *Show Time* (Ember): <ul><li>Element start time can now be displayed as an absolute time (e.g. 8:05:25 pm) on show page <li>Elements start times can now be displayed in absolute time in the text output file <li>Began changing over to use Moments.js library for displaying durations </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Displaying the times in absolute time is a watershed moment. The application is now usuable, for realz. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 82 Work: [100doc-d82 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d82) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 83 | Thu September 14 | <h4>Day 83 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember):<br> Added feature to download show elements to a CSV file. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Went looking for JavaScript CSV libraries, didn't find a good fit. Since I was just outputing CSV and my elements are very well known, it was easy to write a custom solution. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 83 Work: [100doc-d83 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d83) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 84 | Fri September 15 | <h4>Day 84 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember):<ul><li>Update ember-cli to 2.15.1 <li>Made over/under human readable </ul> <h4>Thoughts</h4> Not a lot of sleep last night. Surprised at how smoothly the coding went in spite of that. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 84 Work: [100doc-d84 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d84) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 85 | Sat September 16 | <h4>Day 85 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[Javascript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did exercise \#22: Follow Along Links <li>Did a bit of work/research on a project to cleanup HTML from external sources.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> It's hard finding a good overview of using the DOM node objects. |
| 86 | Sun September 17 | <h4>Day 86 Progress:</h4> Did more work on the HTML cleaner project, which was mostly playing around with the API in code to understand how to work with it. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Already a long day when I started, brain was barely up to the task. |
| 87 | Mon September 18 | <h4>Day 87 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* (Ember): <br>Working on the ability to save and restore shows to/from files. <li>Worked on HTML cleaner. Do not understand the DOM API well enough to use it, switched to regex. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>Saving a JSON object is easy. Getting it back from file has some unexpected challenges. Using the browser's file upload isn't well documented. <li>Really need to find a good overview of the JavaScript DOM API. </ul> |
| 88 | Tue September 19 | <h4>Day 88 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <br>Finished the save-to-file/load-from-file functionality. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Not fighting coding errors so much, these days. Guess I'm learning it :) <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 88 Work: [100doc-d88 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d88) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
