| 76 | Thu&nbsp;September&nbsp;7 | <h4>Day 76 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[Javascript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Watched exercise \#21 - Geolocation. <li> *Show Time* (Ember): <br>Finished the Show edit/create modal dialog with associated template updates. Like the way it works much better now. Ran into a bug and had to work around it by renaming show.length attribute to show.showLength. Work merged to master branch and new demo deployed.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Making the show edit/create modal dialog a component really cleaned up the template and controller code. Totally worth it. Went smoother than I thought, looks like I have a better understanding of component context, now. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 76 Work: [100doc-d76 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d76) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 77 | Fri September 8 | <h4>Day 77 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <br>Added the start time for each show element to the show page. A bit of a challenge since the element start time depends on the length of all the previous elements. Wasn't sure how to do it in Ember. After a false start it all came together. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Today I both loved and hated Ember. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 77 Work: [100doc-d77 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d77) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 78 | Sat September 9 | <h4>Day 78 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember):<br> A few little things: <ul><li>Tweak to "colon" format option (00:00:00) on format-length helper <li>Added help text to Create Show modal inputs <li>Started on a show length over/under display <li>Renamed show.showLength to show.slotLength </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4>Have all the basic functionality. Removing the rough edges and improving the UI/UX. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 78 Work: [100doc-d78 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d78) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 79 | Sun&nbsp;September&nbsp;10 | <h4>Day 79 Progress</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <ul><li>Installed ember-moment (moment.js). Going to replace display functions with it. <li>Fixed secondsToDisplayLength unit test <li>Added an improved string-to-time input parser: parseStringToSeconds, and added unit tests for it. This provides error messaging for bad input and will replace stringToSeconds. <li>Implemented parseStringToSeconds on shows/show add element input and added error messages </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> I really like the improved UX with the error messages but it's a lot more work to implement than I expected. It makes the form handling more complicated. A bit frustrating how I keep finding edge cases to deal with. Unit testing for parseStringToSeconds was incredibly helpful. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 79 Work: [100doc-d79 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d79) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 80 | Mon&nbsp;September&nbsp;11 | <h4>Day 80 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <ul><li>Switched Show create/edit modal to new time parser and added validation to slot length field <li>Completed refactoring of showLength to slotLenght <li>Fixed an edge case issue parsing "ns n" <li>Updated time parser so space between value and unit is ok (e.g.: 1 m) </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Close to the point of being done with this. Thinking about my burn down list. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 80 Work: [100doc-d80 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d80) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 81 | Tue September 12 | <h4>Day 81 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <ul><li>Updated element create/edit to use the new time parser <li>Added validation for show start time <li>Start time now stored in a normalized way </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Continue to be impressed by the power of Ember computed properties. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 81 Work: [100doc-d81 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d81) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 82 | Wed September 13 | <h4>Day 82 Progress:</h4>  *Show Time* (Ember): <ul><li>Element start time can now be displayed as an absolute time (e.g. 8:05:25 pm) on show page <li>Elements start times can now be displayed in absolute time in the text output file <li>Began changing over to use Moments.js library for displaying durations </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Displaying the times in absolute time is a watershed moment. The application is now usuable, for realz. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 82 Work: [100doc-d82 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d82) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 83 | Thu September 14 | <h4>Day 83 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember):<br> Added feature to download show elements to a CSV file. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Went looking for JavaScript CSV libraries, didn't find a good fit. Since I was just outputing CSV and my elements are very well known, it was easy to write a custom solution. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 83 Work: [100doc-d83 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d83) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 84 | Fri September 15 | <h4>Day 84 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember):<ul><li>Update ember-cli to 2.15.1 <li>Made over/under human readable </ul> <h4>Thoughts</h4> Not a lot of sleep last night. Surprised at how smoothly the coding went in spite of that. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 84 Work: [100doc-d84 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d84) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 85 | Sat September 16 | <h4>Day 85 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[Javascript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did exercise \#22: Follow Along Links <li>Did a bit of work/research on a project to cleanup HTML from external sources.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> It's hard finding a good overview of using the DOM node objects. |
| 86 | Sun September 17 | <h4>Day 86 Progress:</h4> Did more work on the HTML cleaner project, which was mostly playing around with the API in code to understand how to work with it. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Already a long day when I started, brain was barely up to the task. |
| 87 | Mon September 18 | <h4>Day 87 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* (Ember): <br>Working on the ability to save and restore shows to/from files. <li>Worked on HTML cleaner. Do not understand the DOM API well enough to use it, switched to regex. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>Saving a JSON object is easy. Getting it back from file has some unexpected challenges. Using the browser's file upload isn't well documented. <li>Really need to find a good overview of the JavaScript DOM API. </ul> |
| 88 | Tue September 19 | <h4>Day 88 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <br>Finished the save-to-file/load-from-file functionality. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Not fighting coding errors so much, these days. Guess I'm learning it :) <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 88 Work: [100doc-d88 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d88) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 89 | Wed September 20 | <h4>Day 89 Progress:</h4> *Show Time* (Ember): <br>Did a bit of code review and cleanup. Tweaked a couple of UI elements, and updated landing page and README. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> That's it for a while! There are so many things I'd like to do and try but it's time to switch up projects. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 89 Work: [100doc-d89 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d89) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime)</ul> |
| 90 | Thu September 21 | <h4>Day 90 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[Javascript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did exercise \#23: Speech Synthesis <li>JavaScript HTML cleanup code: More experimenting with DOM API. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> The HTML produced by MS Word is so, so bad. |
| 91 | Fri September 22 | <h4>Day 91 Progress:</h4> Finished the HTML cleaner code. Can take the HTML output from MS Word and create clean/sanitized HTML. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Second time was the charm. Working directly on the DOM rather than trying to pass around an array of DOM nodes was a better approach. I thought this bit of code would be a couple of hours, but clearly I didn't understand the DOM API as well as I thought. Good learning. |

| 92 | Sun September 24 | <h4>Day 92 Progress:</h4> *[Javascript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did Ex \#24: Sticky Nav and Ex \#25: Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling, and Once. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Two short exercises. Sticky Nav is fun but Event Capture was incredibly useful. |
| 93 | Mon September 25 | <h4>Day 93 Progress:</h4> *[Javascript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did Ex \#26 Follow Along Dropdown. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> I keep saying it, but it's still true, I need to learn more about CSS animation. |
| 94 | Tue September 26 | <h4>Day 94 Progress:</h4> *HTML Code Cleaner*<br> Taking the HTML code cleaner proof-of-concept code and throwing a UI around it. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Mostly went smoothly but have run into a problem with the iframe I'm using to load code. Still learning my way around trouble-shooting DOM issues. |
| 95 | Wed September 27 | <h4>Day 95 Progress:</h4>  *HTML Code Cleaner*<br> Have a basic working site. Switched from trying to load the document in an iFrame to using regex to grab the body copy. Disadvantage is I no longer get automatic character set conversion from 'windows-1252' to UTF. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Really annoyed the iFrame tecnique stopped working. I must have changed something, but I can't determine what it is. New method is arguably better because there's no change of loading scripts from HEAD, but in my reading it seems like scripts wouldn't run in any event. Now I don't have verify one way or another. |
| 96 | Thu Sep 28 | <h4>Day 96 Progress:</h4> *HTML Code Cleaner* now *Each For All - Word to News*<br> <ul><li>Created a Github repo for project <li>Cleaned up the UI a bit <li>Made project available on Github pages <li>Started working on the character conversion</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Say what you will about PHP, there's a character conversion function built in. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Word to News* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/efa-word-to-news](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>*Word to News* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/efa-word-to-news](https://dale42.github.io/efa-word-to-news)</ul> | 
| 97 | Fri Sep 29 | <h4>Day 97 Progress:</h4> *Each For All - Word to News*<br> Digging into character conversion thing. Loading the text doesn't work the way I thought it did. The Filereader object is loading the characters as UTF-8. When it doesn't recognize the Windows 1252 character set it translates it a character unknown symbol. I thought I could load and then convert, but the original character is lost. Looking at alternative ways of doing this. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Character conversion, always a pain in the ass. A bit frustrating, a bit stalled. |
| -- | Sat Sep 30 | -- |
| 98 | Sun Oct 1 | <h4>Day 98 Progress:</h4> *Each For All - Word to News*<br> Figured out the character set issue. Filereader takes character set as a parameter. The document loads correctly and is converted to UTF-8. Created a load sequence that starts Windows 1252 and falls back to UTF-8 if Windows 1252 isn't detected in the header character set. Can add other sets if required. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> The more elegant way of doing this might be loading as a binary string then doing the character detection. The Filereader docs recommend not using the binary option for production. Also, character detection gets pretty hairy. Compromised with loading the file twice. More reliable, faster, and straight forward than writing a binary to character conversion. <h4>Links to Work:</h4> <ul><li>*Word to News* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/efa-word-to-news](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>*Word to News* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/efa-word-to-news](https://dale42.github.io/efa-word-to-news)</ul> | 
| 99 | Mon Oct 2 | <h4>Day 99 Progress:</h4>*Each For All - Word to News*<br> Tried adding a cool transition when the document loads. Do not understand the CSS animation well enought to do this. Work didn't yield any useful results. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Really need to do a deep dive on CSS transitions and transforms. |
