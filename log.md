| 51 | Sun&nbsp;August&nbsp;13 | <h4>Day 51 Progress:</h4>  <ul><li>*[Javascript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*:<br> Did Day 3 - Update CSS Variables with JS <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> Dug into configuring responsive images with the *Responsive Image* module. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>First look at CSS variables. Syntax is weird, but functionality is great. Wonderful there's clean JS methods for updating the variables. <li>Oh vey, so much planning required for implementing responsive images using the modules. Not something I'd want to do by the seat of my pants.</ul> |
| 52 | Mon&nbsp;August&nbsp;14 | <h4>Day 52 Progress</h4> <ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "Day 4: Array Cardio Day 1" exercise. <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Have gotten bogged down in the theming, which isn't my strength. Took a step back and mapped out how to move forward.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>The JavaScript 30 exercise on arrays was excellent. I had noodled around with filter, map, and reduce in the past, but hadn't really dug into them. <li>I miss Emily, the designer/themer I used to work with! She made theming look so easy. Hoping the planning I did today helps move me forward a bit faster than the current pace.</ul> |
| 53 | Tue August 15 | <h4>Day 53 Progress:</h4><ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "Day 5: Flex Panel Gallery" exercise. <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Began building out the site section pages using Panels. Some big differences from Drupal 7.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4><ul><li>*Javascript 30*: Another fun exercise. The info on Flex box arguably weak, but strength of exercise was showing how to use for UX. <li>Not sure Panels is the best choice for implementing sections. The implementation is still anemic. Going to try. Panels still seems more elegant than page visibility rules. <li>Moving the taxonomy listing from system generated to View generated in D8 has an annoying side-effect. In D7 the term display could be selectively overriden. Now the View has to disabled, mean you have to replace the default.</ul> |
| 54 | Wed&nbsp;August&nbsp;16 | <h4>Day 54 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "#6: Ajax Type Ahead" exercise. <li>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Continued on building out the site. I have a minimum viable release, now. Need to go back to theming.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>Today's *JavaScript 30* exercise really helped me wrap my head around the power of map and filter. Also liking the improvements in ES6. Native JavaScript is much nicer to work in. <li>Back to the theming on *Group 42*. Needing to deep-dive into the design.</ul> |
| 55 | Thu August 17 | <h4>Day 55 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "#7: Array Cardio 2" exercise. <li>*Show Time* (Ember): <br>Time to give this some love. Reviewed my work to date against what I know and planned how to move forward.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>*Javascript 30*: Another cool exercise <li>*Show Time*: Was very nice to realize in my planning that I now have an interalized conceptual knowledge of Ember. Very basic, but there. Will see how accurate it is when I implement my new architecture. </ul> |
| 56 | Fri August 18 | <h4>Day 56 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "#8: HTML 5 Canvas" exercise. <li>*Show Time* (Ember): <br>Started working on the refactoring. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>*Javascript 30*: I played around with HTML 5 Canvas once before, but just for creating an image from program results. It was nice encorporating user interaction (mouse events) into the canvas manipulation. <li>*Show Time*: After a little of bit refactoring I decided it's probably easy to start from scratch. Things started getting messy and confusing pretty quickly. I'm not so far along that I think it would take any longer. I really want to be a large workblock of into this. Can only currently only do short workblocks and it's frustrating.</ul> |
| 57 | Sat August 19 | <h4>Day 57 Progress:</h4> <ul><li>*[JavaScript 30 Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/)*: <br>Did the "#9: 14 Must Know Dev Tools Tricks" exercise. <li>*Show Time* (Ember): <br>Blew away the old repository and started fresh. Implemented the Add/Delete/List functionality and set up GitHub pages demo app.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> *Show Time* <ul><li>Starting from scratch was definitely the right thing to do. I regret loosing the Issues and some of the comments. <li>Things go so much quicker when you've already written the code somewhere else :) </ul> <h4>Links to Work</h4> <ul><li>*Show Time* GitHub Repository: [github.com/dale42/showtime](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) <li>Day 57 Work: [100doc-57 Branch](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-d57) <li>*Show Time* Demo App: [https://dale42.github.io/showtime](https://dale42.github.io/showtime) </ul> |
