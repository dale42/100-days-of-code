# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
June 22, 2017

## Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
3. I will, where possible, push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges; proof-of-concept code or learning examples; patches or contributions to open source projects; or targeted code-challenge exercises that improve coding skills. Website building with a UI (e.g., Drupal or WordPress) is included as long as it isn't content authoring. The time spent doing online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
1. To increase the chances of success, where possible I will add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub or other public repository, or a link to a blog post. If code can't be pushed to GitHub or a public repository, I will provide a link to a tweet.
