| Day | Date | Progress &amp; Thoughts |
|:--:|:--:|---|
| 1 | Thu&nbsp;June&nbsp;22 | **Today's Progress:**<br>Applied Drupal configuration management setting to site rebuild script and refactored script to use variables instead of hardcoded values<br><br>**Thoughts:**<br>- Feels like a weak start, but it is what it is<br>- Always takes longer to test than I expect<br>- Would be nice to work this into a template<br>- BASH is archane <br><br>**Link to work:** [site-rebuild.sh](https://gist.github.com/dale42/be415d17404151d49baacb20a1400317) |
| 2 | Fri&nbsp;June&nbsp;23 | **Today's Progress:**<br>Started on radio programming timing app named *ShowTime*. Will be a simple, one-page Ember app. Thumbnailed design, created GitHub repo, and created initial app.<br><br>**Thoughts:** Feels good to be coding.<br><br>**Link to work:** [ShowTime on Github](https://github.com/dale42/showtime) |
| 3 | Sat&nbsp;June&nbsp;24 | **Today's Progress:**<br>Worked on *ShowTime* app. Wrote my first Ember unit test. Updated models.<br>2hr 39m<br><br>**Thoughts:**<br>I hate this part of the learning curve where a simple thing can take hours to figure out. Realized after I coded it that displayLength doesn't belong on module. Need to refactor into something that gives raw minutes and seconds. Did lots of research that didn't count towards the coding.<br><br>**Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day3-work |
| 4 | Sun&nbsp;June&nbsp;25 | **Today's Progress:**<br>*ShowTime* app: Added local storage, show item display, and the ability to create and delete show items. Discovered that unit tests wouldn't run when the serializer and adapter tests were present.<br><br>**Thoughts:**<br>Bootstrap is a mixed blessing. Stoked at figuring out how to sum the times from the times from individual items and display as a total.<br><br>**Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day4-work |
| 5 | Mon&nbsp;June&nbsp;26 | **Today's Progress:**<br>*ShowTime* app: Initially thought it would be a one-page style calculator, but since local storage was so easy decided to expand and allow multiple shows. Did not merge *100doc-day05-work* branch into *master*, app is in an inbetween state.<br>- Cleaned up show item table<br>- Added /show page to list shows<br>- Added show add/delete functions<br>- Added /show/:showId route<br>- Researched drag and drop sorting of items in radio show. <br><br>**Thoughts:**<br>Damn you Jim Butcher and you're books that make me stay up late reading so I'm tired the next day<br><br> **Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day05-work |
| 6 | Tue June 27 | **Today's Progress:**<br>*ShowTime* (Ember) app:<br>- Handles multiple shows<br>- Cleaned up "the look"<br>- Researching date-time libraries.<br><br>**Thoughts:**<br>The Ember Data hasMany/belongsTo relationship is really finicky.<br><br>**Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day06-work |
| 7 | Wed June 28 | **Today's Progress:**<br>*ShowTime* (Ember) app: Only a small code update, creating a show takes you the newly created show page. Discovered that doing input validation is a rabbit hole and spent the rest of my available time researching.<br><br>**Thoughts:**<br>Would have never guessed at the lack of support input validation has in core Ember.<br><br>**Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day07-work |
| 8 | Thu June 29 | <h4>Day 8 Progress:</h4>*ShowTime* (Ember) app:<ul><li>Refactored some display elements into components ( dale42/showtime#15, dale42/showtime#16) <li>Updated show delete to remove child show-items (dale42/showtime#12). This doesn't seem to be an ember-data feature. <li>Created a GitHub Pages site for project (dale42/showtime#3): https://dale42.github.io/showtime <li>Updated project README.md </ul>   <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>Components are brutally simple, at least to start. Wish I'd checked them out sooner. <li>Adding the ability to deploy to GitHub pages went more smoothly than I expected. <li>Committing the deployment into the repo makes this less a project for others to clone than a standalone app, but I'm OK with that, for now.</ul> **Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day08-work |
| 9 | Fri June 30 | <h4>Day 9 Progress:</h4>*ShowTime* (Ember) app: <ul> <li>Converted the create-show form input into a component in atticipation of adding input validation. First component where I had to deal with actions so more involved than yesterday. <li>First attempt at input validation. Discovered ember-cp-validations isn't a good fit for my workflow. Details here, [Issue 9 - ember-cp-validations](https://github.com/dale42/showtime/issues/9#issuecomment-312335120). Have the code on a local feature branch if I need it in the future. </ul>   <h4>Thoughts:</h4> I never thought validation would be such a pain in the ass.    <br><br>**Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day09-work |
| 10 | Sat July 1 | <h4>Day 10 Progress:</h4>*ShowTime* (Ember) app: <br> After seeing my tweet a Vancouver colleague recommended [ember-validated-form](https://github.com/adfinis-sygroup/ember-validated-form). Started implementation. It's validating the input but I can't read the form data. Work left uncommitted.  <h4>Thoughts:</h4>Happy Canada Day! <br><br>**Link to work:** https://github.com/dale42/showtime/commits/100doc-day10-work |
| 11 | Sun July 2 | <h4>Day 11 Progress:</h4>*ShowTime* (Ember) app: <br>Even though validation is working, implying that the implementation is sound, I can't fetch the inputed values from the form. Investigated to the best of my skills, still not great with Ember Imspector et al. No progress on the code. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> A bit frustrated I haven't been able to figure this out. Probably time to ask for help. |
| 12 | Mon July 3 | <h4>Day 12 Progress:</h4>*ShowTime* (Ember) app: <br>After one last attempt to figure it out I submitted an issue to project.  <h4>Thoughts:</h4> In these kinds of situations I typically move on to try a different module. Given I respect the module recommender so the module should be a good fit and that 100 Days of Code is about learning I decided to try submitting an issue to the project. <br><br>**Links to work:** <ul><li>https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-day12-work <li>[adfinis-sygroup/ember-validated-form: Accessing form data in action #38](https://github.com/adfinis-sygroup/ember-validated-form/issues/38) </ul> |
| 13 | Tue July 4 | <h4>Day 13 Progress:</h4>*ShowTime* (Ember) app: <br>Got a wonderfully fast answer back from module maintainer! Have a working validation solution on /show page. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Grateful for the fast response from [czosel](https://github.com/czosel) on GitHub.  <br><br>**Links to work:** <ul><li>https://github.com/dale42/showtime/tree/100doc-day13-work <li>[adfinis-sygroup/ember-validated-form: Accessing form data in action #38](https://github.com/adfinis-sygroup/ember-validated-form/issues/38) </ul> |
| 14 | Wed July 5 | <h4>Day 14 Progress:</h4>*ShowTime* (Ember) app: <br>Still experiencing problems. Code worked when records were already present but didn't work with an empty database. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> I'm wondering if something about my configuration is different from the intended usecase. |
| 15 | Thu July 6 | <h4>Day 15 Progress:</h4>*ShowTime* (Ember) app: <br>Tried out [ember-changeset](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-changeset), which [ember-validated-form](https://github.com/adfinis-sygroup/ember-validated-form/) is built on. Experiencing the same error, so this is an ember-changeset issue. Getting an error that an underlying model can't be created. Think I've traced it to sample init code and a validator object not being created. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Frustrated. Have spent too much time on validation. |

| 16 | Sun July 9 | <h4>Day 16 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Drupal 8 Upgrade/Migration Planning for [Group42.ca](http://group42.ca). <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Time to give this project a bit of love. The current site (Drupal 7) has some content-type experiments that need consolidating. Also have a slightly different method of content referencing I want to implement. Designing and planning implementation. |
| 17 | Mon July 10 | <h4>Day 17 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <br>Continued Drupal 8 upgrade/migration planning for [Group42.ca](http://group42.ca). Expected to do some actual coding today, but thanks to planning discovered some additional planning best done up front. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Knew I was keeping a lot of the migration details in my head but I didn't realize how much. Because I'm taking the time to document up front I'm hoping the actual coding will go faster. That's the theory, it isn't always the reality. Regardless, I'll have a checklist of things I can use in other upgrade/migrations. <br><br>**Links to work:** None yet. Will need to do a blog post at some point. |
| 18 | Tue July 11 | <h4>Day 18 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): Got my base Drupal configuration into my automated build script. Using the [Configuration installer](https://www.drupal.org/project/config_installer) profile and the [Default content](https://www.drupal.org/project/default_content) module. <h4>Thoughts:</h4>It's cool how easy the Drupal configuration management system makes this. Life isn't perfect, but this is so much better raw scripting. |
| 19 | Wed July 12 | <h4>Day 19 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal): <ul><li>A bit more tweaking of my base configuration <li>Began working on the content migration. Had my notes to fall back on so the initial setup went very quickly. User migration was dead easy. Began working on taxonomy term migration. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Migration is easier if you have a strong understanding of the configuration management system. I wish migration did a better job of error messages. |
| 20 | Thu July 13 | <h4>Day 20 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> Finished the taxonomy term migration and have basic node migration working. Have an issue with the pre-created taxonomy terms getting overwritten, will need to create them after the migration. Have to identify a replacement for the code filter I used for displaying code examples. <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Using YAML files for process pipeline definition is like a magic incantation. |
| 21 | Fri July 14 | <h4>Day 21 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> <ul><li>Fixed the issue with content import and migration interfering with each other. <li>Refactored the build script into a site-reset and make-content scripts. The migratation and import scripts now leave no artifacts behind. Important since once they're run the final time they're no longer required. <li>Still have a problem with my migration module cleaning up after itself. It's not removing it's configuration. Had to add additional code in the script to do the cleanup. <li>Updated my migration and implementation documents. <li>Choose CodeSnippet module for displaying code examples in content.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> It is so cool seeing real content in the new site. |
| 22 | Sat July 15 | <h4>Day 22 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> <ul> <li>Spend some time trying to debug the migrate code cleanup issue. Asked for assistance on Drupal Stack migration channel. Did some digging in the code. Could not solve the issue. Since I do have a work-around this isn't critical. I decided to move on to other work. <li>Started work on a Migrate plugin that infers terms for a Section vocabulary based on the tags vocabulary. Have a basic skeleton in place. The module code was easy comparied to figuring out the syntax to adding it to the migration yaml file. <li>A bit more documentation updating. </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> <ul><li>Excited that I'm at the stage where I start writing migration plugins. It's something of a milestone. <li>Not warming up to using yaml to define migrations. Would be OK for basic field mapping. Gets messy very quickly when iterators and process pipelines come into play. <li>Spending way more time than I typically do on documentation. It's a bit of a long-term experiment to see if it's useful later on. Or not. Hoping it will pay off in the future. I think it will, if only as a template of what information to capture for a new site build.  </ul> |
| 23 | Sun July 16 | <h4>Day 23 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> <ul><li>Completed the Infer Section migrate plugin <li>Learned a little bit about working with Taxonomy objects <li>Started working on a migrate plugin to tweak classes on body content so it works with Drupal 8 CSS </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Nice to be far enough up the learning-curve I got to purely code for a short while. |
| 24 | Mon July 17 | <h4>Day 24 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> <ul><li>Installed the Drupal code linter, [Coder](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder) <li>Ran the linter against my plugins and updated them to conform <li>Investigated how WYSIWYG images are managed in Drupal 8 and began planning how to import them </ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4>  Looks like there's another learning curve to climb |
| 25 | Tue July 18 | <h4>Day 25 Progress:</h4>*Group 42 Website* (Drupal):<br> <ul><li>Have file migration working <li>Started on migration plugin to convert image tag src attribute to use the migrated file <li>My workflow for updating the live config from the migration .yml config file is broken. Probably the Drupal 8.3.5 update.</ul> <h4>Thoughts:</h4>Good news/bad news day, fortunately more good. That learning curve wasn't as step as I thought it would be but the broken workflow is a pain. Using the configuration system to define migrations is just so wrong. |
